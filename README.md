# WaveModeling
It is a function that creates Jonswap/Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum and a wave based on that.
This file also has two examples: example.m and Drawing_both_spectrum.m.
The first one shows how to use the code and the second one shows the difference between Jonswap and Pierson-Moskowitz spectrums.

Please refer to section 2.3.1 of the following dissertation:
